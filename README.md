# Thomas Fire Analysis

The purpose of this data analysis is to dissect and display the effects of the Thomas Fire that occurred on December 4th, 2017 in Santa Barbara and Ventura

# About

This repository contains a notebook, ThomasFire.ipynb, that analyzes the air quality index and atmospherically corrected surface reflectance and surface temperature image data in California in order to display the effects of wildfires on air quality and the creation of land scars.

# Visualization

After examining raster and vector datasets, a Matplotlib map was created to show a false color image of the resulting fire scar from the Thomas fire in 2017

created to show the distinct area affected by the Thomas fires using satellite data. Another visualization was created to display the relationship between the date of the fires to the air qualoty index. trend in air quality from before and after the wildfires.

data seems to be related to air quality, and the chart may show how the Air Quality Index has evolved since the 2017 Thomas Fires, with a specific focus on a five-day average

choropleth map showing the number of oil spills per county in the state of New York from January to October 2023. This map is located in the images/ directory.
